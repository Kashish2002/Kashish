# Landing Page — Services & Contact

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS implementation that recreates a landing page layout with:

- A header with a "Services" menu that shows a dropdown on hover and hides when the mouse leaves.
- A Contact button that opens a modal popup. The popup includes a close (X) button and will close when clicking outside or pressing Escape.
- Responsive styles for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Files:
- `index.html` — page structure
- `styles.css` — layout and responsive styles
- `script.js` — dropdown & modal interactions

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server).

Notes:
- This implementation uses only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS as requested.
- The layout and spacing are tuned to match a typical Figma design: adjust font sizes, colors or spacing in `styles.css` to match your exact Figma tokens if you provide them.
